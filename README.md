# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis on Zomato restaurant data to uncover key business insights related to customer preferences, restaurant performance, pricing strategies, and online delivery trends.

The objective is to identify data-driven patterns that influence restaurant success on food delivery platforms and to demonstrate a complete real-world data analytics workflow — from raw data ingestion to insight generation and reporting.
## Why This Project Matters

Food-tech platforms like Zomato generate massive volumes of data daily. Converting this raw data into meaningful insights is critical for improving customer experience, optimizing restaurant strategies, and increasing platform revenue.

This project simulates a real-world business intelligence scenario where raw operational data is transformed into actionable insights for decision-making.

## Technologies Used

* Microsoft Excel  
  - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
  - Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts  
  - Interactive Dashboard Design  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset

The project uses the original Zomato restaurant dataset stored in the raw data directory.

*Dataset Location:*

The raw dataset was cleaned and transformed before analysis.
## Data Pipeline

The project follows a structured data analysis pipeline:

1. Raw data is stored in data/raw/
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing is performed in Excel
3. Cleaned datasets are stored in data/processed/
4. Analysis and dashboards are generated from processed data

This structure ensures reproducibility and professional data management practices.
